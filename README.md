 - Repository : https://github.com/DataPaulette/Tapis_sensitif/
 
This project is under construction, all codes are work in progress. 

#/Tapis_sensitif/I2C_network_processing/
This folder include Ã  processing sketch allowing mapping to trigger MIDI notes. \
The following contributed libraries are needed
 - theMidiBus
 - controlP5

#/Tapis_sensitif/I2C_matrix_MASTER/
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software \
This folder include the Arduino code for the master device plugged on a computer via USB port. \

#/Tapis_sensitif/I2C_matrix_SLAVE/
This folder include the Arduino code for each sensitive slab device that communicate  over a four wire I2C bus. \

#/Tapis_sensitif/Eagle_board/
This folder include the Eagle source code of the electronic board made for the project. \

the file 7_BIT_ARRAY_COUNT.csv is useful to configure the dip switch of each board. \
This 7 bit dip switch is used to configure the address of each board. \

Linux START virtal midi : modprobe snd-virmidi
